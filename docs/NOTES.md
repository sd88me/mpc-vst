# Notes: native VST2 plugins on MPC OS standalone

Origin: mpc-forums thread "Proof of Concept: Custom Standalone Plugins"
(viewtopic.php?f=48&t=220981, Sep 2026). Verified on a Force (MPC OS, with MockbaMod) 2026-09-23; paths below are
from the Force and may differ on MPC Live/One/X/Key (e.g. `Force Documents` vs `MPC Documents`).

## Facts (verified)

- `/usr/bin/MPC` contains `"pluginList"` + `"-arm"`, `KNOWNPLUGINS`, `VSTPluginMain`.
- Settings: `/media/az01-internal/Settings/MPC/MPC.settings`. Edit **with `acvs`
  stopped**; back it up first (malformed XML ⇒ MPC resets it to defaults).
- Entry format:
  `<PLUGIN name="X" descriptiveName="X" format="VST" category="Synth|Effect" manufacturer="V"
  version="1.0" file="/sdcard/vst/x.so" uid="<hex uniqueID>" isInstrument="0|1" fileTime="0"
  infoUpdateTime="0" numInputs="2" numOutputs="2" isShell="0"/>`
- Device: armv7l, glibc 2.39 (build with an older glibc, e.g. `arm32v7/gcc:12` docker = 2.36).
- Audio: 44100 Hz, 128-frame period, which is identical to the Move/Schwung, so DSP runs unmodified.
- AEffect magic must be `'VstP'` (0x56737450). **The forum snippet's magic is wrong.**
- Instruments: set `effFlagsIsSynth`, category 2, answer `effCanDo "receiveVstEvents"`;
  MIDI arrives via `effProcessEvents`.
- Tempo: `audioMasterGetTime` with `kVstTempoValid` works for synced LFOs.
- State: `effFlagsProgramChunks` + `effGetChunk`/`effSetChunk`.
- Skin search path is `SynthContentLocations` in MPC.settings; `/sdcard/Synths` is one of them
  (also `/media/662522/Synths`, `/usr/share/Akai/Content/Synths`).
- Skin folder name `<manufacturer> - VST - <plugin name>` matched. Reference skins:
  `/usr/share/Akai/Content/Synths/*/Plugin Skins/` (e.g. Decimator = simple, Bassline = 4 tabs,
  knobs + `btnBypass` + `slider` + `comboBox` + `Label` + `Focus`).
- `importFiles` in `TUI.json` resolve relative to the skin; use absolute
  `/usr/share/Akai/Content/Synths/...` paths when the skin lives elsewhere.
- Component library: `AKAI Components/AKAI Generic Components.json` (knobBlack/Blue/Green/Grip/
  Point/Red/Silver/Witch/Yellow). Bassline defines its own `btnBypass`, `comboBox`, `slider` locally;
  that's where to copy switch/button/menu definitions from.

## Open issues (from first Maze Voice test)

1. ~~Enums render as knobs.~~ Done: option params are radio groups of image `Button`s
   (`buttonId` i of `numButtonsInGroup` N, all bound to the same parameter, option text drawn into our PNGs,
   as in the stock Hype skin). A VST2 can't give MPC value lists, so `comboBox` menus open empty. Off/on params are toggle
   buttons; `access:"write"` params are triggers (the wrapper sends `audioMasterAutomate` 0 after they fire).
   Q-Link nudges step option params one option at a time (wrapper `setParameter`).
   Original note: Labels are right. Next: use a `comboBox` (menu) for multi-option
   enums and a button type (`btnBypass`-style, 2 states) for on/off and momentary (`rnd_go`).
   Copy the definitions from Bassline's `localComponentDefinitions`, since they are local there, not
   in the generic library.
2. ~~Some knobs show blank~~ Done: stock knobs only draw their value; names come from background
   art. We add `Label` `"type": "Name"`. Original note: **Some knobs on a page show blank** while their Q-Link works. Suspect: a missing `Label`
   component (stock skins add Labels and `Focus` overlays), or knob bounds/`showWhenDataModelInvalid`.
   Compare the rendered page against Bassline's component set.
3. Note timing is quantised to 128-frame DSP blocks (same as Move).
4. `gen_vst.py` is Maze-specific (NAME/UID/TABS at the top). Next: read those from a small per-port
   `vst.json` next to `module.json` so any Schwung module (force-acid, …) ports with no code.
5. Maze's knob-touch note filter (notes 0..9) is compiled out with `-DMAZE_VST=1`, which is built but
   **not yet deployed** (md5 b10668a4…).
6. **MIDI-output plugins: MPC OS ignores plugin MIDI out** (tested 2026-09-23 with `poc/midiout.c`).
   MPC never asks canDo `sendVstEvents`/`sendVstMidiEvent` (only `receiveVstMidiEvent`, `bypass`);
   `audioMasterProcessEvents` is accepted silently and the events go nowhere. A plugin can't be picked as
   a MIDI input on another track, and the track's "MIDI send to" only forwards the notes coming *into* it.
   Transport/tempo via `audioMasterGetTime` do work (flags 0x7fc4, tempo and ppqPos valid), and so does MIDI in.
   **Workaround, verified 2026-09-23 (`poc/midiport.c`):** the plugin opens its own ALSA sequencer client/port
   (`snd_seq_create_simple_port`, CAP_READ|SUBS_READ; link `-lasound`, which ships with MPC OS) and sends notes
   with `snd_seq_event_output_direct`, synced to host `ppqPos`/tempo. MPC's own seq client ("MPC") hot-detects the
   new port, creates a matching input ("<client> <port>") and connects it with no restart. Enable Track on it in
   Preferences → MIDI, then any track can select it as MIDI input. Plugin sequencers/arps can drive other tracks.
   Most likely stock MPC OS behaviour: MockbaMod's MidiLoop (`tkgl_anyctrl_lt.so`) only filters or blacklists
   ports; it doesn't create them. Not yet confirmed on a stock unit. Latency is about one audio block (direct, unscheduled send).

## Skin layout facts (verified 2026-09-23)

- Nested pages: several `tabs` entries with the same `fnKeyIndex` and `fnKeySubIndex` 0,1,2…; Q-Link map
  entries use `Tab` = fnKeyIndex+1, `SubTab` = fnKeySubIndex+1 (as in stock DrumSynthMulti).
- Q-Link numbering: the 4x4 grid counts from the bottom row up (stock: top-left control = Q-Link 13). With
  `Bank Direction: Column`, the Force's 8 knobs read bank 1 = Q-Links 13,9,5,1,14,10,6,2 and bank 2 = those +2.
  `gen_vst.py` lays each page out as 2 rows of 8 (row = knob bank) and maps through that order.
- Custom geometry (2026-09-23): `tools/shadow_skin.py` takes a Force Shadow style layout file per port
  (Maze: `force-maze/maze-voice/vst/layout.conf`) and emits `TUI.json` with free placement, a per-tab
  background image (frames and labels baked in), a knob filmstrip per radius (128 frames, `numFrames` 127, as in
  stock strips), and on/off images for toggles, triggers and option segments. Shadow canvas y 86..714 maps to the
  1280x628 plugin area. Several `qlinks` lines in one tab become nested pages that share the design but have
  different Q-Link sets. Values are MPC `Label` `Value` components (Titillium; the baked labels use the shadow font).
  Not yet seen on device.

## Beyond synths: apps as plugins (probe run on a Force 2026-09-24)

A VST2 plugin is ordinary native code inside the MPC process, which has root, the network and the
filesystem. force-shadow (LD_PRELOAD in the same process) already makes HTTP calls and writes files from there,
so a plugin should be able to as well. `poc/netprobe.c` checks this on a device: DNS + HTTP, a file write into the
documents folder, `posix_spawn` of `/bin/sh` and of a script on /sdcard (noexec check). Log: `/tmp/netprobe.log`.

Rules for app-like plugins:
- Never block the audio thread: network, disk and child processes go on a worker thread; audio goes through a ring buffer.
- Spawn children with `posix_spawn` (vfork-style), not `fork()`: forking MPC's large, multithreaded,
  real-time process copies its page tables (audio dropouts), and only async-signal-safe calls are allowed before exec.
  The webstream/cratedigger core uses `fork()` in two places (yt-dlp daemon, ffmpeg pipe), so switch those.
- A plugin crash takes MPC down with it, so risky parts (yt-dlp/Python, ffmpeg) belong in a child process.
- UI is only the skin: parameters with display strings, static images, buttons. No text entry, no dynamic lists or
  images. Dynamic text works through parameter display strings, e.g. "Result 1..8" slot params whose value text
  is a track title, and filter enums for genre/style/decade.
- Files the plugin writes appear in MPC's browser; the plugin can't tell MPC to load a program.

Probe results (Force, MPC OS + MockbaMod, 2026-09-24): the plugin runs as **uid 0**. DNS + HTTP work
(example.com 200; api.discogs.com answers 301 to HTTPS, so real APIs need TLS). Writing to
`/sdcard/Force Documents/` works. `/sdcard` is ext4 mounted rw with exec allowed.
**Spawning children:** `posix_spawn` itself works, but the child inherits MPC's environment, and on MockbaMod
units that includes `LD_PRELOAD` of C++ libraries (mockbaMagic.so, tkgl_anyctrl_lt.so) that fail in a plain
process ("undefined symbol _ZSt4cout", exit 127). Always spawn with a cleaned environment (drop LD_PRELOAD).
Stock MPC OS has no such preload.
